**ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Alan Thomas**
------
I am a junior web developper. I am passionated about learning new things. Right now I am using mainly Next.js and Node.js but I am open to learn any new technology. I have recently completed my first commission based on Next.js and Strapi (with custom lifecycles) featuring i18n, SSR and SGR. I am very proud of it and have learned a ton with it , even if a big part of that is what I would do differently :)

**ðŸŒ± What am I currently learning ?**

While I am constantly trying to learn new things, I am currently trying to tame the over excitement that comes with the seemingly never ending new frameworks and libraries :) if you look at my repos you'll see that a lot of them have a some issues. I like to look at how much I advanced (although I don't forget how long the road ahead is) and chose not to go back and refactor them. It gives me a good idea on what to work on moving forward .

I am working on becoming a better programmer by focusing on :

- Code cleanliness/organisation
- Better planning  and preparation 
- Design pattern
- Unit testing

My objective is to become a good programmer , regardless of framework or language. Technolgy wise, I am currently working with and learning :

- Next.js and React
- Typescript
- Unit testing with Jest and React-Testing-Library
- Mantine
- Express.js
- GraphQL
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma
- Firebase
- Strapi

I have currently two projects in the work that I am excited about. One will be a multiplayer game that uses Typescript and Websocket ! The other one will be a full fledged full stack app made with Nest.Js (on Fastify) , Prisma, Postgres and Next.js.

Although I have barely started deeping my toes in it , I am very interested in learning Rust and Svelte.
